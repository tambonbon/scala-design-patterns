- We have handlers which use the implemented functions lying inside `PermissionRepoImpl` and `UserRepoImpl`.
- These handlers take `Repo` as the dependency.
- There're 2 ways to do DI on handlers:
  - Constructor Injection
    - Default
    - Easy
  - Reader Monad

- Main concern of Constructor Injection:
  - functions required `Repo` as its argument
  - when dependencies are injected at the top level, they have to be passed around from one function to another, regardless whether there's anything uses them
  - `Reader Monad` lets us encode dependencies directly into the type, while providing compose-ity e.g. `map` `flatMap`.
