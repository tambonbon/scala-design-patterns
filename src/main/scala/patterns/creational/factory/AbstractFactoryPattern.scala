/** The purpose is the same as all factory design patternsâ€”to encapsulate the
  * object creation logic and hide it from the user. The difference is how it is
  * implemented.
  *
  * The abstract factory design pattern relies on object composition in contrast
  * to inheritance .. .. which is used by the factory method. Here, we have a
  * separate object, which provides an interface to create instances of the
  * classes we need.
