## Pros:
- Bridge pattern is similar to adapter, but we apply it for desigining our application
- Benefit: 
  - We avoid ending up with exponential number of classes in the app
  - Separation of hierachy allows us to independently extend them without affecting the others

## Cons:
- Boilerplate code
- Might complicate the use of our library
- Might be a good idea to combine it with other creational pattern
