## Pros
- Add a lot of flexibility
  - They don't change our original classes, thus:
    - They don't introduce errors in our old codes
    - Fewer maintenaince effort
    - Prevent us from forgetting or not foreseeing some use cases when we first created classes

## Cons
- Overusing could cause issues
  - Might end up with large amount of small classes
- Complicating instantiation process, which would need some creational patterns like factories or builders
