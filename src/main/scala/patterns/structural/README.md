“Structural design patterns are concerned with composing objects and classes in our software. They use different approaches in order to obtain new functionality and larger and potentially more complex structures. These approaches include the following:

- Inheritance
- Composition


Properly identifying the relationships between objects in an application is key to simplifying the application's structure.”
